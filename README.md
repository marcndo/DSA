# DSA

## This repo is aimed at practicing data structures and algorithms from two different sources.
* DSA with https://dl.ebooksworld.ir/books/Introduction.to.Algorithms.4th.Leiserson.Stein.Rivest.Cormen.MIT.Press.9780262046305.EBooksWorld.ir.pdf
* DSA with https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/

## With the first link above, the objective will be to implement the algorithms in the text.
## Design and implement new algorithms from the exercises in python programming languages.
## In the long run, the algorithms implemented in python will be translated to C++.
