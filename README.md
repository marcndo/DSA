# Data Structure and Algorithms

This repository aims at developing skills in data structures and algorithm. 
Two resources are considered in this process. 
1. An ebook from MIT press titled [introduction to algorithm](https://dl.ebooksworld.ir/books/Introduction.to.Algorithms.4th.Leiserson.Stein.Rivest.Cormen.MIT.Press.9780262046305.EBooksWorld.ir.pdf) by (Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, Clifford Stein). This textbook has pseudocode for some of the algorithms and exercises some of which includes designing new algorithms. In this case, the objectives are as follows.
   * implement the Psuedo codes designed in the textbook, for better understanding of how they work.
   * Complete the exercises in the textbook.
   * Majority of these exercises include one of the following:
     + Design new algorithms.
     + Analyse algorithms with Big-O notation.
     + Proof correctness of algorithms.
     + Walk an input set through an algorithm etc.
2. Data Structures and Algorithms path by Google from [Tech Dev Guide](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/data-structures-and-algorithms/).
